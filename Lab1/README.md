# Lab 1: GPIO and FSMs
The purpose of this lab is to investigate and understand General-Purpose In/Out (GPIO) and how Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are implemented in C using the IAR Embedded Workbench Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on TIVA LaunchPad.

## Task 1
### 1a: Sequencial LEDs
This task was to change the main program and the header file to turn on and off all of the LEDs in a sequential pattern.
### 1b: Button Control
This task was to create a new program that turns on LEDs using the user switches (buttons), turning on LED1 when SW1 is pressed and LED2 when SW2 is pressed.

## Task 2: Simple Traffic Controller
This task was to make a traffic light controller by designing a FSM for the light system with an on/off button only utilizing on-board switches (buttons) and LEDs.
